# Matrix
Work in Progress.

## Terms used:

Constructors: The ways a user can call the matrix to init it (control size, inital values, and more).  
Basic operations: Operations that allow users to handle part so the Matrix, i.e. get and set values in the matrix.  
Matrix Operations: Complex Matrix operations such as multiplacation, transpose, and inverse.  
Operator overide: Allows users to do Matrix opertions using only simple operators such as "+" instead of a function.  

## Milestones:
 * Header file: Complete (Matrix.h)
 * Cpp outline (function stubs): Complete (Matrix.cpp)
 * Makefile: Complete (Makefile)
 * Unit tests: In progress (tests.h and test.cpp)
